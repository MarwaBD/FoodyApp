        * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
        * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
        * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
            * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

<h1>Ingredient</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>1 2/3 cups (200 g) plain gluten free flour blend</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (65 g) almond flour</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp xanthan gum</li>
    <li>3 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>pinch of salt</li>
    <li>2 sticks (226 g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>zest of 3 lemons</li>
    <li>4 medium eggs, room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (120 mL) milk, room temperature</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla paste</li>
    <li>6 tbsp lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<h1>Preparation steps</h1>
<hr>
<ol>
    <li>Pre-heat the oven to 355 ºF (180 ºC) and line a loaf baking tin with greaseproof/baking paper. (Dimensions of loaf tin: 8.5 inch/21cm long, 4.5 inch/11cm wide and 3inch/7cm high.)</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, sift together the gluten free flour blend, almond flour, xanthan gum and baking powder. Add the sugar and salt, and mix until combined.</li>
    <li>Add the softened butter and, using either a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or a hand mixer with the double beater attachments, work the butter into the dry ingredients until you get a texture resembling coarse breadcrumbs in size</li>
    <li>Add the lemon zest. In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, milk, vanilla and lemon juice. Add the wet ingredients to the dry+butter mixture, and whisk/mix well until no flour clumps remain and everything is evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cake batter into the prepared loaf tin, smooth out the top, and bake in the pre-heated oven at 355 ºF (180 ºC) for about 1 hour or until risen, golden brown on top and an inserted toothpick comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Allow to cool in the loaf tin for about 10 minutes, then remove from the tin, and allow to cool completely on a cooling rack.</li>

</ol>
